# vulcanoplot_breastcancer2Dvs3D

Differentially expressed genes comparing MCF-7 3D day 7 vs MCF-7 2D day 7 and MDA-MB-231 3D Day7 vs MDA-MB-231 2D day 7 were visualized by volcano plot 
using the ggplot2 package in R. The significance thresholds for up and down-regulated genes were set to the adjusted p-value < 0,05 and the log2 fold-
change values ³ |± 0,38|. The top 10 DEGs were highlighted (dark grey), and several important genes were marked (black).
